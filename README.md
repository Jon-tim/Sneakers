# Sneaker E-commerce Product Page

## Brief

The project is centered on building out an e-commerce product page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

    1. View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
    2. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
    3. Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
    4. Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
    5. Add items to the cart
    6. View the cart and remove items from it
